# Deep-Learning-Framework-For-Early-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-COVID19-
In this work, a novel multimodal learning framework is proposed for the early diagnosis and accurate classification of COVID-19 patients using deep learning techniques and speech signal processing techniques. The proposed framework consists of a chest X-ray-based model and cough (audio) model to extract features from the chest X-ray and cough database using a deep U-Net and convolutional neural network. Extracted features are used fused using the weighted sum-rule fusion method and ensemble deep learning techniques to predict COVID-19 cases accurately.
This project is currently under review as a research paper in IEEE transactions on Artificial Intelligence.
